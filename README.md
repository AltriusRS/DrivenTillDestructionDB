# DrivenTillDestructionDB

A site containing compiled scores of every vehicle ever to partake in FailRace's "Driven Till Destruction" series

This project was started on February 20th 2021 and has been tirelessly analysing the show since then.

It is my hope that maybe FailRace will recognise this effort and allow us access to a spreadsheet of vehicles he has
covered, but until that happens, we will continue to do our best estimation from the videos available to YouTube

## Website Progress

The website is currently under development, until such a time as we have an alpha version ready to test, no links will
be available. You are permitted to attempt to run the site locally, but we will not be providing guides on how to do
this.

## Permissions

Whilst we have reached out to FailRace on Twitter to request permission to do this, we have not yet had a response from
him. We are attempting to do this project without the need for permission being granted, but ultimately it is up to
FailRace to determine if we are okay to do this. We are doing our best to ensure that our use of his content remains
under "fair use", and will continue to pursue explicit permission from FailRace on the subject.

# What is this about?

This website displays the content of a database, which contains every single vehicle ever sent around any of the 4 (to
date) Driven Till Destruction test circuits. The goal is to allow users to compare vehicles across seasons, episodes,
and maps, with minimal effort. We aim to provide a wonderful to use website and easy to access database with hundreds of
vehicles across hundreds of episodes. This database will be kept as up to date as is permissible at the time of the
release of new episodes.

# What was the motivation to make this?
I was really bored at home, and thought that having a single online webpage where we could compare the performance of vehicles across seasons and episodes would be a great idea.
I foolishly thought it would be quick and simple to do, but having spent 3 hours going through 8 videos and filling out the database, i quickly realised what i had gotten myself into. I decided to push on since i had already contacted FailRace with the concept, and was eagerly awaiting permission to collaborate with him on the project. I do not yet have this permission, but im working on it.
